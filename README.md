These are my solutions to the problems I've solved from the website leetcode.com using python. 
I'll be uploading the solutions to more problems as I solve them.  NOTE: I have uploaded only the "solution class" of the code. 
And it's also for sql, excel comparison with python
If you want to run the code, please copy and paste it in the corresponding problem page's editor on the leetcode website.
And the names of the file are consisting of two parts. Knowledge-leetcodenumber

## note for sql

it also include git and shell
this is for a trial about git and vim
I hope this could work
